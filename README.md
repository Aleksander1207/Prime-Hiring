# prime-hiring

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember application.
A short introduction of this app could easily go here.

------------------------------------------SETUP GUIDE---------------------------------------------------

This is the setup guide for Prime Hiring.

## Prerequisites -> SETUP Guide Here:

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (with npm)
* [Ember CLI](https://ember-cli.com/) -> From here you only need to run 'npm install -g ember-cli' in your terminal
* [Google Chrome](https://google.com/chrome/)

## Installation -> SETUP Guide Here:

After you have all the prerequisities installed properly, create a folder whereever you would like to, open git terminal there and run the following comand:
* `git clone <repository-url>` this repository -> url : https://github.com/Aleksander1207/Prime-Hiring

Open the terminal and locate yourself at the prime-hiring folder:
* `cd prime-hiring` -> you need to get into this folder

Install npm
* `npm install`

## Running / Development -> SETUP Guide Here:

After you have installed npm you need to run only 1 more command in the prime-hiring folder:
* `ember serve`

Now open chrome and visit the following url:
* Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

You can visit this url as well, but I have not worked on any tests for the application so there is nothing interesting
* Visit your tests at [http://localhost:4200/tests](http://localhost:4200/tests).
